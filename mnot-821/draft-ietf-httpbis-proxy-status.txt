1.  Introduction

   HTTP intermediaries - including both forward proxies and gateways
   (also known as "reverse proxies") - have become an increasingly
   significant part of HTTP deployments.  In particular, reverse proxies
   and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) form part of the critical
   infrastructure of many Web sites.

   It is sometimes useful to append information to messages about
   intermediaries' operation, without changing the message content
   itself.  For example, it's helpful to know details of their
   configuration and operational conditions for debugging purposes.  To
   enable that, Section 2 defines a new HTTP header field to convey that
   information.

   Additionally, in some cases responses are generated by the
   intermediary itself, rather than being forwarded from the origin
   server.  For example, this can happen when there is a configuration
   error, or there is a problem in communicating with the origin server.

   HTTP accommodates these types of errors with a few status codes; for
   example, 502 Bad Gateway and 504 Gateway Timeout.  However,
   experience has shown that more information is necessary to aid
   debugging and communicate what's happened to the client.

Internet-Draft         Proxy-Info and Proxy-Status             July 2019


   To address this, Section 3 defines a new HTTP response header field
   to explicitly indicate that the response was generated by an
   intermediary, not the origin server, and to convey additional details
   using the Proxy Status Types defined in Section 3.2.  Section 3.3
   explains how to define new Proxy Status Types.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses Structured Headers
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure] to specify syntax.  The terms sh-
   param-list, sh-item, sh-string, sh-token and sh-integer refer to the
   structured types defined therein.

   Note that in this specification, "proxy" is used to indicate both
   forward and reverse proxies, otherwise known as gateways.  "Next hop"
   indicates the connection in the direction leading to the origin
   server for the request.

2.  The Proxy-Info HTTP Header Field

   The Proxy-Info HTTP response header field allows an intermediary to
   append debugging information to the HTTP messages that it sends; it
   is not intended for use by protocol mechanisms (e.g., caching,
   content handling, redirection).

   Proxy-Info is a Structured Headers
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure] Parameterised List, where each
   item in the list indicates an intermediary node that has handled the
   response.  The order of the list is in the order the response was
   handled (i.e., in the direction of origin to user agent).

   Each param-item's primary-id is a sh-string that identifies the
   intermediary generating that value; it MAY be a hostname, IP address,
   or alias.  Its parameters carry Proxy Information Types that convey
   additional information about that intermediary's handling of the
   request.

   For example:

Internet-Draft         Proxy-Info and Proxy-Status             July 2019


   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Proxy-Info: "ReverseProxy"; f_proto="h1",
               "ExampleCDN"; f_proto="h2",
               "proxy.isp.example.net"; f_proto="h2"

   This response has passed through three intermediaries; first a
   reverse proxy, then a CDN, and then a forward proxy.  The reverse
   proxy's forward connection to the origin server was over HTTP/1,
   whereas the other two used HTTP/2.

   Section 2.1 lists the Proxy Information Types defined in this
   document; new ones can be defined using the procedure outlined in
   Section 2.2.

   Proxy-Info MAY be sent in HTTP trailers, but - as with all trailers -
   it might be silently discarded along the path to the user agent, this
   SHOULD NOT be done unless it is not possible to send it in headers.

   Note that there are various security considerations for
   intermediaries using the Proxy-Info header field; see Section 5.

   Origin servers MUST NOT generate the Proxy-Info header field.

2.1.  Proxy Information Types

   This section lists the Proxy Information Types defined by this
   document.  See Section 2.2 for information about defining new Proxy
   Information Types.

2.1.1.  Forward Protocol

   o  Name: f_proto

   o  Type: sh-string

   o  Description: indicates the ALPN protocol identifier [RFC7301] used
      to connect to the next hop.  This is only applicable when that
      connection was actually established.

2.1.2.  Details

   o  Name: details

   o  Type: sh-item

   o  Description: Implementation or deployment-specific details that
      are not expressed elsewhere.

Internet-Draft         Proxy-Info and Proxy-Status             July 2019


2.2.  Defining New Proxy Information Types

   New Proxy Information Types can be defined by registering them in the
   HTTP Proxy Information Types registry.

   Registration requests are reviewed and approved by a Designated
   Expert, as per [RFC8126], Section 4.5.  A specification document is
   appreciated, but not required.

   The Expert(s) should consider the following factors when evaluating
   requests:

   o  Community feedback

   o  If the value is sufficiently well-defined

   o  If the value is generic; vendor-specific, application-specific and
      deployment-specific values are discouraged

   Registration requests should use the following template:

   o  Name: [a name for the Proxy Information Type that is allowable as
      a sh-param-list key]

   o  Type: "[a Structured Headers type for the payload\]"

   o  Description: [a description of the nature of the information]

   See the registry at https://iana.org/assignments/http-proxy-infos [4]
   for details on where to send registration requests.

3.  The Proxy-Status HTTP Header Field

   The Proxy-Status HTTP response header field allows an intermediary to
   indicate the nature and details of an error condition it encounters
   when servicing a request.  It is only included on responses that are
   generated by an intermediary.

   Proxy-Status is a Structured Headers
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure] Parameterised List, where each
   item in the list indicates an error condition.  Typically, it will
   have only one param-item (the error condition that triggered
   generation of the response it occurs within), but more than one value
   is not prohibited.

   Each param-item's primary-id is a Proxy Status Type, a registered
   value that indicates the nature of the error.

Internet-Draft         Proxy-Info and Proxy-Status             July 2019


   Each param-item can have zero to many parameters.  Section 3.1 lists
   parameters that can be used with all Proxy Status Types; individual
   types can define additional parameters to use with them.  All
   parameters are optional; see Section 5 for their potential security
   impact.

   For example:

   HTTP/1.1 504 Gateway Timeout
   Proxy-Status: connection_timeout; node="SomeCDN"; tries=3

   indicates the specific nature of the timeout as a connect timeout to
   the origin with the identifier "abc", and that is was generated by
   the intermediary that identifies itself as "SomeCDN."  Furthermore,
   three connection attempts were made.

   Or:

   HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
   Proxy-Status: http_request_error; node="SomeReverseProxy"

   indicates that this 429 Too Many Requests response was generated by
   the intermediary, not the origin.

   Each Proxy Status Type has a Recommended HTTP Status Code.  When
   generating a HTTP response containing Proxy-Status, its HTTP status
   code SHOULD be set to the Recommended HTTP Status Code.  However,
   there may be circumstances (e.g., for backwards compatibility with
   previous behaviours) when another status code might be used.

   Section 3.2 lists the Proxy Status Types defined in this document;
   new ones can be defined using the procedure outlined in Section 3.3.

   Proxy-Status MAY be sent in HTTP trailers, but - as with all trailers
   - it might be silently discarded along the path to the user agent,
   this SHOULD NOT be done unless it is not possible to send it in
   headers.  For example, if an intermediary is streaming a response and
   the upstream connection suddenly terminates, Proxy-Status can be
   appended to the trailers of the outgoing message (since the headers
   have already been sent).

   Note that there are various security considerations for
   intermediaries using the Proxy-Status header field; see Section 5.

   Origin servers MUST NOT generate the Proxy-Status header field, and
   Intermediaries MUST NOT generate it on a response that is forwarded
   from another server.

3.1.  Generic Proxy Status Parameters

   This section lists parameters that are potentially applicable to most
   Proxy Status Types.

   o  node - a sh-string identifying the intermediary generating this
      Proxy Status Type.  MAY be a hostname, IP address, or alias.

   o  tries - a sh-integer indicating the number of times that the
      indicated error occurred when attempting to satisfy the request.

   o  details - a sh-string containing additional information not
      captured anywhere else.  This can include implementation-specific
      or deployment-specific information.

3.3.  Defining New Proxy Status Types

   New Proxy Status Types can be defined by registering them in the HTTP
   Proxy Status Types registry.

   Registration requests are reviewed and approved by a Designated
   Expert, as per [RFC8126], Section 4.5.  A specification document is
   appreciated, but not required.

   The Expert(s) should consider the following factors when evaluating
   requests:

   o  Community feedback

   o  If the value is sufficiently well-defined

   o  If the value is generic; vendor-specific, application-specific and
      deployment-specific values are discouraged

   Registration requests should use the following template:

Internet-Draft         Proxy-Info and Proxy-Status             July 2019


   o  Name: [a name for the Proxy Status Type that is allowable as a sh-
      param-list key]

   o  Description: [a description of the conditions that generate the
      Proxy Status Types]

   o  Extra Parameters: [zero or more optional parameters, typed using
      one of the types available in sh-item]

   o  Recommended HTTP status code: [the appropriate HTTP status code
      for this entry]

   See the registry at https://iana.org/assignments/http-proxy-statuses
   [5] for details on where to send registration requests.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Upon publication, please create the HTTP Proxy Status Types registry
   at https://iana.org/assignments/http-proxy-statuses [6] and the HTTP
   Proxy Information Types registry at https://iana.org/assignments/
   http-proxy-infos [7], populating them with the types defined in
   Section 3.2 and Section 2.1 respectively; see Section 3.3 and
   Section 2.2 for their respective procedures.

5.  Security Considerations

   One of the primary security concerns when using both Proxy-Info
   Proxy-Status is leaking information that might aid an attacker.  That
   information might be about the intermediary configuration, its
   topology, about the origin server, or about message content and
   message metadata.

   As a result, care needs to be taken when deciding to generate these
   headers.  Note that intermediaries are not required to generate them,
   and can conditionally generate them based upon request attributes
   (e.g., authentication tokens, IP address).

   Likewise, generation of all parameters is optional.
